Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (Kahramaa) has secured first position for its employee app under the category of ICT application e-employment.

This came within the announcement of the electronic projects that won the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) 2021 awards organised under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

The award winning Kahramaa app enjoys many features and its modern and practical design have won the recognition of the most important experts at the international level. The app took lead among selected electronic projects that have been developed in various parts of the world, including 10 projects qualified for the third stage (the voting stage) from the State of Qatar.

The World Summit on the Information Society is the most prominent international platform for presenting the most important and successful electronic projects, and this year it included a large number of candidates, including a number of government agencies, companies, civil society institutions, international organizations, academic bodies and others.

This year, 10 electronic projects have been qualified, from Qatar representing a number of sectors and Qatari government agencies, for the third stage of the evaluation (the voting stage).

Kahramaa took the lead among them as the only entity from the State of Qatar to qualify for the fourth and final stage of evaluation, after which it was honoured to get first place in its category out of five international projects nominated from around the world.

Kahramaa app has been developed in line with its objectives to achieve integration between quality and modernisation, and contribute to improving the user experience and meet their diverse needs.

The app includes over 30 digital services developed in cooperation with the Human Resources Department at Kahramaa. It provides employees with all their needs and provides them with the required information round the clock.

The services include the service of sending an official leave request, the service of sending an electronic work card, the service of tracking the employeeâ€™s working days and hours, the service of requesting and receiving certificates.

Since its establishment, Kahramaa has been keen to keep pace with the latest technologies used in all fields, and this has been reflected in the satisfaction of its customers and the quality of its services.

The app helped reduce dependency on traditional paper transactions among employees achieving goals of preserving the environment a n d r e s o u r c e s f o r sustainability.
