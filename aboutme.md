## About Me

From a young age, I have been deeply passionate about technology. As a child, I would take apart gadgets and toys to understand their inner workings. During the Java and Symbian era, I managed a hobby website using my Sony Ericsson K510i Java mobile device. This WAP site provided downloads for ringtones, wallpapers, and apps.

My journey into mobile app development began in college when I purchased my first Android device running Android 2.1 Eclair. I explored kernel tweaks, custom ROM flashing, OS patching, and even managed to enable a single-touch screen to function as a multi-touch screen.

In my third and fourth years of college, I assisted my friends by developing five Android apps for their electronics and civil engineering projects, primarily focusing on IoT solutions.

After graduating, I joined NeST IT, where I received extensive on-the-job training in professional software development. My experience spans front-end web development with JavaScript, back-end development with Java, and creating standalone geospatial computing Python scripts that leverage the full potential of computer hardware through parallel processing. Eventually, I dedicated myself fully to iOS development.

I was fortunate to lead the initial team in starting Swift-based iOS app development. I presented the advantages of using the Swift programming language and Apple's standards. We developed multiple iPad and iOS apps for different clients and some innovative proof-of-concepts (POCs).

As part of an onsite deployment from NeST IT, I joined Kahramaa as the Lead iOS Developer. Our team worked on enhancing the code quality and work environment of iOS and mobile projects, creating new applications and setting up an MDM enterprise deployment system. One such MDM-based enterprise application, the "Employees" App, won the Best E-Employment Award at an international competition (WSIS).

I led a 10-member team of mobile developers in UI/UX, architecture, and development of native iOS and Android apps for the main app store app, the "Kahramaa" App. Our hard work paid off as we won the Best Mobile Application Award in the Gulf region in 2023.

I am currently leading the mobile development efforts at Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (KAHRAMAA).
