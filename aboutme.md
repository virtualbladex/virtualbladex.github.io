### My story

I have been keen to technology since my child hood. Used to take apart and learn from gadgets & toys. I had a hobby website during the Java & Symbion time, fully managed using my Java mobile device (Sony Ericsson K510i). The wap - website used to provide items such as ring tones, wallpapers and apps for download.

I bought my first Android device running Android 2.1 Eclair during my college time. I started my mobile app development with it. Have done many kernal tweaks, custom ROM flashing, OS patching, even found a way to make the single touch screen device to act like multi touch.

During my 3rd and 4th year of college I helped my friends by creating 5 Android apps for their electronics & civil projects. Mostly IoT based.

After collage I joined NeST IT and have got a lot of on-the-job training on professional software development. 

Worked on front end webdevelopment using Javascript, Backend development using Java, 
have created standalone geo spatial computing python scripts by leverating full potential of computer hardware using parallel processing. Then I got fully dedicated to iOS development.
